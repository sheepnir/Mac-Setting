# Mac Backup and Clean Install Preparation Guide

This guide will walk you through backing up your Mac configurations (particularly terminal settings and ZSH) before performing a clean installation of macOS.

## Step 1: Create a Backup Directory

First, create a dedicated directory to store your configuration backups:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs
mkdir -p ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/zsh
mkdir -p ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/oh-my-zsh/custom
mkdir -p ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/terminal
mkdir -p ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/terminal/vscode
```

## Step 2: Backup ZSH Configuration Files

Copy your ZSH configuration files to the backup directory:

```bash
# Backup ZSH configuration files
cp ~/.zshrc ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/zsh/
cp ~/.zprofile ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/zsh/ 2>/dev/null
cp ~/.zshenv ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/zsh/ 2>/dev/null
cp ~/.zlogin ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/zsh/ 2>/dev/null
cp ~/.zlogout ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/zsh/ 2>/dev/null
```

## Step 3: Backup Oh My ZSH Customizations

If you're using Oh My ZSH, backup your custom themes, plugins, and settings:

```bash
# Backup Oh My ZSH custom directory
if [ -d ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom ]; then
    cp -R ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/* ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/oh-my-zsh/custom/
fi
```

## Step 4: Backup Terminal Settings

Backup your Terminal and iTerm2 (if used) preferences:

```bash
# Backup Terminal.app preferences
cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/terminal/

# Backup iTerm2 preferences (if installed)
if [ -f ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist ]; then
    cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/terminal/
fi

# Backup VS Code terminal settings
if [ -d "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User" ]; then
    cp "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json" ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/terminal/vscode/ 2>/dev/null
fi
```

## Step 5: Create Metadata File

Create a metadata file with information about your current system:

```bash
cat > ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/backup-metadata.txt << EOF
Backup created on: $(date)
macOS version: $(sw_vers -productVersion)
Hostname: $(hostname)
ZSH version: $(zsh --version)
Shell: $SHELL
Oh My ZSH: $(if [ -d ~/.oh-my-zsh ]; then echo "Installed"; else echo "Not installed"; fi)
Oh My ZSH Theme: $(if [ -f ~/.zshrc ]; then grep "ZSH_THEME" ~/.zshrc | cut -d'"' -f2; else echo "Not found"; fi)
EOF
```

## Step 6: Backup Homebrew Packages (Optional)

If you're using Homebrew, you might want to backup your installed packages:

```bash
# Create a list of installed Homebrew packages
if command -v brew &> /dev/null; then
    brew bundle dump --file=~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/Brewfile
    echo "Homebrew packages list saved to Brewfile"
fi
```

## Step 7: Backup Important Application Settings

Backup settings for any critical applications:

```bash
# Create application settings directory
mkdir -p ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/apps

# Example: Backup VS Code settings
if [ -d "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User" ]; then
    mkdir -p ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/apps/vscode
    cp "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json" ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/apps/vscode/
    cp "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/keybindings.json" ~/Developer/Mac-Setting/Configs/apps/vscode/ 2>/dev/null
fi
```

## Step 8: Transfer Backup to External Storage

Copy your backup directory to an external drive or cloud storage:

```bash
# Replace /Volumes/ExternalDrive with your actual external drive path
cp -R ~/Developer/Mac-Setting /Volumes/ExternalDrive/
```

## Step 9: Prepare for Clean Installation

Before proceeding with a clean install:

1. Sign out of Apple ID and iCloud
   - Go to System Settings > Apple ID
   - Scroll down and click "Sign Out"

2. Turn off Find My Mac
   - You'll be prompted to do this when signing out of iCloud

3. Deauthorize your computer from iTunes/Music
   - Open iTunes/Music
   - Go to Account > Authorizations > Deauthorize This Computer

4. Sign out of Messages
   - Open Messages app
   - Go to Messages > Settings > iMessage
   - Click "Sign Out"

5. Back up any other important data
   - Documents, photos, and other personal files
   - Use Time Machine for a complete system backup

## Step 10: Create a macOS Installation Media (Optional)

If you want to perform a clean installation without relying on the Recovery mode:

1. Download the latest macOS version from the App Store
2. Insert a USB flash drive (at least 16GB)
3. Use the following command to create a bootable installer:

```bash
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sonoma.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
```

Replace "Sonoma" with your macOS version and "MyVolume" with your USB drive's name.

## Step 11: Perform Clean Installation

1. Restart your Mac and hold down Command (âŒ˜) + R to enter Recovery Mode
2. Use Disk Utility to erase your startup disk
3. Install macOS
4. Follow the setup assistant to configure your Mac as new

## Step 12: Verify Installation

After installation:

1. Check System Settings > General > Software Update to ensure you have the latest macOS version
2. If needed, install any additional updates

Congratulations! You now have a clean installation of macOS. You can proceed to restore your backed-up configurations using the restoration guide.
